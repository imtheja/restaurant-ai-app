## ðŸŽ¯ Example Session

```
You: "Hi, I'm looking for something comforting"
AI: "Welcome! For comfort food, I highly recommend our Molten Chocolate Cake...
     or if you prefer something savory, the Grilled Atlantic Salmon..."

You: "I'm vegetarian actually"
AI: "Perfect! In that case, our Thai Red Curry Bowl would be ideal...
     It's completely vegan and packed with comforting flavors..."

You: "That sounds good, tell me more"
AI: "Our Thai Red Curry Bowl features authentic red curry with coconut milk...
     It has a spice level of 4 out of 5, takes about 15 minutes..."
